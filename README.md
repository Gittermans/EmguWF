EmguWF
======

EmguWF is an image processing pipeline designer.

EmguWF uses the EMGU CV image processing library.  

EmguWF provides you with a designer surface, that allows you to, very easily, create custom image processing workflows. In EmguWF, a workflow is created, by simply dragging and dropping pipeline activitities unto the desinger surface. 
With EmguWF, you can create any sequence of activitities, out of a set of predefined elements. If the predefined activities do not fit your needs, you can create your own.

Also, EmguWF allows the user to load or save existing workflows from your local filesystem. 

After the user has setup his custom routine, he can run it against an image, by pressing the 'Run Workflow' button.
